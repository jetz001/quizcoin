Here is the complete timeline of the QuizCoin ecosystem in English.

QuizCoin Ecosystem Timeline
This document summarizes the development of the QuizCoin ecosystem, designed in 9 phases to guide participants from a simple quiz game platform to a comprehensive ecosystem that drives knowledge creation, research, and real-world business ventures.

Phase 1: Gameplay and Coin Rewards
This is the starting point of the ecosystem. All players can easily join the QuizCoin Game without personal registration. They only need to connect their MetaMask wallet to start playing. Players will receive QuizCoin (QZC) as a reward for every correct answer.

Player Ranking System
After joining, every player will have their own cumulative score used for ranking to reflect their status and progress within the ecosystem.

Scoring System: Player scores are derived from four main components:

Accuracy Score: The primary score from answering quiz questions correctly.

Consistency Score: Points awarded for continuous participation.

Creation Score: Points for creating valuable content like new questions or research proposals.

Achievement Score: Bonus points for notable achievements in competitions.

Ranking Tiers: Players are ranked by their total score, divided into 5 main groups and 20 tiers:

Tiers 1-4: Initiates

Tier 1: Score 1-250 Learner

Tier 2: Score 251-500 Trainee

Tier 3: Score 501-750 Student

Tier 4: Score 751-1,000 Apprentice

Tiers 5-8: Scholars

Tier 5: Score 1,001-1,500 Researcher

Tier 6: Score 1,501-2,000 Tutor

Tier 7: Score 2,001-2,500 Specialist

Tier 8: Score 2,501-3,000 Scholar

Tiers 9-12: Sages

Tier 9: Score 3,001-4,000 Insightful

Tier 10: Score 4,001-5,000 Expert

Tier 11: Score 5,001-6,000 Sage

Tier 12: Score 6,001-7,000 Educator

Tiers 13-16: Masters

Tier 13: Score 7,001-8,500 Innovator

Tier 14: Score 8,501-10,000 Master

Tier 15: Score 10,001-12,000 Genius

Tier 16: Score 12,001-15,000 Pioneer

Tiers 17-20: Directors

Tier 17: Score 15,001-20,000 Director

Tier 18: Score 20,001-25,000 Dean

Tier 19: Score 25,001-30,000 Chancellor

Tier 20: Score 30,001+ Grand Director

Phase 2: Forming Academies
In this phase, players can team up to form an Academy (similar to a guild or team) to compete. Each Academy has a Ranking based on the combined scores of its members. They will participate in continuous seasonal International Quiz Show (IQS) competitions.

Internal Structure: The founder of an Academy holds the title of Director. New members are Students, and the Director can appoint outstanding students as Professors.

Scoring System: An Academy's score comes from four main parts:

Performance Score: Points from members' IQS competition results.

Consistency Score: Points for continuous participation.

Community Contribution Score: Points for creating value for the overall ecosystem.

Collaboration Score: Points from working with other Academies.

Ranking and Naming: Academies are ranked by their total score and named according to their status:

1-1,000 Score: College

1,001-5,000 Score: Faculty

5,001-10,000 Score: University

10,001-20,000 Score: Research University

20,001-50,000 Score: Ivy League

Phase 3: Achieving Angel Status
This phase grants special status to the most outstanding Academies. Only groups in the Top 10 of the Ranking, known as The Angelic Council, are eligible for their members to become an Angel. Angels have a crucial role in providing Research Grants for projects voted on in the next phase.

Phase 4: Research Funding
The system allows all Academies to submit research Proposals to seek support.

Proposal Submission: A student who wishes to submit a proposal must first get approval from the Director and a Professor within their own Academy.

The entire community then votes to select the most suitable proposals. Finally, Angels from the Top 10 Academies will approve and release research grants to the selected projects.

Phase 5: Player Contract and Transfer System
To add dynamism and excitement, a secure system for player transfers is implemented.

No NFT Trading: Players are not treated as commodities or NFTs. They retain full ownership of their wallet and private key.

Smart Contracts: Transfers between Academies or the hiring of Free Agents occur through Smart Contracts recorded on the blockchain for transparency and verifiability.

Phase 6: Academic Journal
In this phase, the ecosystem evolves into an academic platform. Academies with outstanding results and advanced knowledge are eligible to publish research papers or discoveries in the ecosystem's Journal. This journal serves as a knowledge base and a hub for information exchange, making QuizCoin more than just a gameâ€”it becomes a platform that creates real-world value and knowledge.

Phase 7: Startup Creation
This final phase establishes a complete path from knowledge creation to real-world business. Companies (Comp) are formed to develop startups based on the knowledge and research published in the Journal.

Competition: Every Comp participates in the International Startup Pitch Series to compete for a ranking. Scoring is based on four main criteria:

Pitch Score: An AI evaluates and selects the top 30 most promising Comp for the final round.

Milestone Score: Points awarded for achieving key milestones (e.g., securing Seed Round, Series A funding).

Community Score: Points from community voting via DAO, measuring direct trust.

Collaboration Score: Points from mentoring or collaborating with other Academies. Approval from a Professor doubles the score in a funding round.

Ranking and Naming: Comp are ranked by their total score and named by their status:

1-1,000 Score: Startup or Beginners

1,001-5,000 Score: Sprouts or Rising Stars

5,001-10,000 Score: Pioneers

10,001+ Score & Top 10: Unicorns, who have the right to co-invest with other Comp and lead the ecosystem.

Phase 8: Community Funding
This phase allows Comp to move beyond Angel funding and raise capital directly from the community.

Funding: Comp can present their projects and business plans to the wider community.

Exchange: In exchange for funding, Comp will provide a portion of the company's value in the form of tokens or assets, which entitles holders to future dividends or profits.

Management: Comp will manage the fundraising and distribute returns to token holders themselves, building a strong relationship between the business and the community.

Phase 9: Domestic Growth
After strengthening the ecosystem's knowledge creation and funding, it's time to expand for wider adoption.

Aggressive Marketing: Launching offline and online campaigns to promote the ecosystem more broadly.

Partnerships: Forming alliances with educational institutions, government agencies, or private companies to use QuizCoin as a tool for learning and talent development.

Local Content: Expanding the quiz database to include local history, culture, and business knowledge to attract users from all regions.

Local Community Managers: Appointing or supporting local community managers in each area to expand the user base and organize local events.
